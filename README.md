# infra/ops | ships prod | cloud-native minimalism

## ❖ about  
i keep critical systems online and inexpensive.  
architect → automate → fade into reliability

## ❖ what i do  
- terraform or yaml everything, button‑click nothing  
- pipelines that roll forward, never sideways  
- dashboards that warn before users notice  
- cost controls that pay for themselves  
- docs that answer the question before slack can ping me

## ❖ now  
senior engineer: full‑stack platform ownership @ a fintech

## ❖ before  
cloud engineering & large‑scale support: built patterns still running

## ❖ origin  
linux boxes, pager duty, certs. automated forward, never looked back.
