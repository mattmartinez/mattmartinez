# infra/ops | ship prod | build tools that run themselves

## ◆ about

i keep critical systems online and inexpensive.
architect → automate → fade into reliability.
lately: building agentic workflows and ops tooling that replace manual clicky clicky.

## ◆ what i do

- terraform or yaml everything, button-click nothing
- pipelines that roll forward, never sideways
- dashboards that warn before users notice
- cost controls that pay for themselves
- agentic automation — AI ops partners, not chatbots

## ◆ building

side projects nobody asked for:
- business intelligence dashboards
- encrypted credential managers
- ops control planes
- automated procurement systems

## ◆ now

senior engineer: full-stack platform ownership @ a fintech.
nights: shipping internal tools for a business i run.

## ◆ before

10 years engineering @ Rackspace — bare metal to openstack to the clouds across 6 regions.
built patterns still running. broke things that taught me more.

## ◆ origin

linux boxes, pager duty, certs. automated forward, never looked back.
